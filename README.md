Here we can all add to dos, issues and things that would be nice to have. I already filled in a few but of course everyone can add more if needed.

# getting started with git
in general I recommend getting a graphical git client like https://desktop.github.com/ or https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ and then you can just clone this repository and always "commit, push, pull" until you run into merge conflicts or similar.

In case you are using visual studio code, git integration is also very well done there.

here is a cheat sheet by git if you want to know more

And of course you can always send a mail if you have questions or issues.

And since I have now told you exactly what the comic says I will include it for reference: https://xkcd.com/1597/
